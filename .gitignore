# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.

# Conda Environment
# It's generally best practice to not commit your environment files to source control,
# since they can be large and are often machine-specific.
# Instead, use `conda env export > environment.yml` to generate a environment file
# that you can share with others.
# See https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#sharing-an-environment

# Data
# Depending on the size and nature of your project, you might want to exclude
# data files too. You should, however, include a sample of your data or a script
# to fetch the data to make it possible for others to reproduce your results.
